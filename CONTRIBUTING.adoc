= Contributing guide

You can help contribute to Anarchy in many ways, including by

== Writing code

* Follow shell scripting best practices (e.g. like in
https://google.github.io/styleguide/shell.xml[Google's shell style guide])
* Try to *avoid Bashism*, by using `checkbashisms` or `shellcheck`
* Use `"${variable}"` instead of `$variable`
* Constants (and global variables) should be in `UPPER_CASE`, other variables
should be in `lower_case`
* Use single square brackets (`[ condition ]`) for conditionals
(e.g. in 'if' statements)
* Write *clean and readable code*
* Write *comments where needed* (e.g. explaining functions)
* Explain what arguments a function takes (if any)
* Use different error codes when exiting and explain when they occur
at the top of the file
* If possible *line wrap at 80 characters*
* Scripts should be named `setup-<function>` and should not have an extension
* Libraries should always have a `.sh` extension and should not have a shebang
* Scripts should be executable, libraries shouldn't
* Use `shellcheck` to error-check your code
* Always *test your code*
* Write *informative commit messages*

== Updating existing translations

Anarchy supports multiple languages, most of which need maintainers.

* Make sure to use the UTF-8 encoding
* Don't change the variable names (e.g. `intro_msg=`)
* Don't remove any occurrence of `\n` or `\n\n` (new lines)
* Don't remove any special characters (e.g. `$a` or quotes)
* Don't edit variables within the text (e.g. `/dev/${DRIVE}` or `${user}`)
* Compare the layout of the finished file with english.conf
* If you intend to maintain the translation, add yourself as a maintainer
at the top of the file (example below)
* If there are existing maintainers, add yourself on a new line below theirs

== Translating Anarchy to new languages

* Copy the `english.conf` file and rename it to your language's english
name (e.g. `portuguese.conf` or `spanish.conf`)
* Update the LANG variable to your language's UTF-8 locale (e.g. `sl_SI.UTF-8`)
* Read the previous recommendations for existing Anarchy translations
